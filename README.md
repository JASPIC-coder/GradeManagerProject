GRADE MANAGER PROJECT

This is a simple Java project created by Christine IRADUKUNDA to manage student grades using arrays and exception handling. 
It was developed as part of an assignment to demonstrate real-world operations like adding, sorting, searching, and calculating grades.

FEATURES:

-  Add grades with limited attempts
-  Automatically reject invalid grades (e.g., above 100 or below 0)
-  Calculate:
            . Average grade
            . Highest and lowest grades
-  Sort grades in ascending order
-  Search for a grade and show its index
-  User-friendly messages and interaction
-  Exception handling for:  .  IllegalArgumentException
                            . ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
                            . try-catch` and `finally blocks

   LEARNING GOALS:

   This project helped me learn:

     - How to use Java arrays in a real-world way
     - How to handle invalid inputs with exceptions
     - How to organize code into classes and methods


HOW TO LEARN:
